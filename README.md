## Docker Desktop
Docker Engine is the core product of Docker, including its daemon (dockerd) as well as its CLI (docker). 

[Docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop) for both mac and windows is using a Linux virtual machine behind the scenes for running regular docker daemon. Docker Desktop can be used either on itâ€™s own or as a complementary tool to the CLI.
